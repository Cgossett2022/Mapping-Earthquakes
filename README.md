# Mapping Earthquakes

## Overview
For this project, I built a map which shows the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world. In order to complete this project, I had to take the following steps:

- Access a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data on the USGS website, which contains coordinates and magnitudes of earthquakes
- Use JavaScript, HTML, and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes from the GeoJSON data
- Use the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map, through the use of an API request
- Create interactivity for the earthquake map
